Current software is becoming larger and more complex. To preserve both functional and non-functional requirements languages to support the development process are necessary. Especially non-functional are growing more important in different domains like automotive or aerospace. Additionally, the process of debugging to resolve side effects can further complicate the development of large software projects.\\
In this paper we introduce PureFun. PureFun is an imperative pure programming language. It aims to combine the advantages of both functional and imperative programming languages by focussing on side effect free functions as well as the performance of the generated code.
To further improve upon other non-functional requirements in PureFun features and design choices are selected. By introducing built-in features for container types, parallelism or data structures the software developed in PureFun remains both readable and maintainable.
